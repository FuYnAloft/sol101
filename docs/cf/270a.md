# 270A. Fancy Fence

geometry/implementation/math, 1100, x23265, https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/270/A

Emuskald needs a fence around his farm, but he is too lazy to build it himself. So he purchased a fence-building robot.

He wants the fence to be a regular polygon. The robot builds the fence along a single path, but it can only make fence corners at a single angle *a*.

Will the robot be able to build the fence Emuskald wants? In other words, is there a regular polygon which angles are equal to *a*?

**Input**

The first line of input contains an integer *t* (0 < *t* < 180) — the number of tests. Each of the following *t* lines contains a single integer *a* (0 < *a* < 180) — the angle the robot can make corners at measured in degrees.

**Output**

For each test, output on a single line "YES" (without quotes), if the robot can build a fence Emuskald wants, and "NO" (without quotes), if it is impossible.

Examples

input

```
3
30
60
90
```

output

```
NO
YES
YES
```

Note

In the first test case, it is impossible to build the fence, since there is no regular polygon with angle ![img](https://espresso.codeforces.com/df5f4b07dd5316fde165b43657b2696e2919e791.png).

In the second test case, the fence is a regular triangle, and in the last test case — a square.



> 【黄旭，2020年秋】对于 n边形，其内角和为（n-2）*180°，内角为x度，有(n-2)\*180=n\*x。 则可以得到 n的表达式为 n=360/（180-x），若 n为整数，则可行，反之不可行。

```python
for i in range(int(input())):
    x=int(input())
    print(['NO','YES'][360%(180-x)==0])    
```

```python
n=int(input())
def check(x):
    if 360%(180-x)==0:
        return"YES"
    else:
        return"NO"

for i in range(n):
    x=int(input())
    print(check(x))
```
