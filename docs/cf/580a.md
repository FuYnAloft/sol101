# 580A. Kefa and First Steps

brute force, dp, implementation, 900, https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/580/A

Kefa decided to make some money doing business on the Internet for exactly *n* days. He knows that on the *i*-th day (1 ≤ *i* ≤ *n*) he makes $a_i$ money. Kefa loves progress, that's why he wants to know the length of the maximum non-decreasing subsegment in sequence $a_i$. Let us remind you that the subsegment of the sequence is its continuous fragment. A subsegment of numbers is called non-decreasing if all numbers in it follow in the non-decreasing order.

Help Kefa cope with this task!

**Input**

The first line contains integer $n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5)$.

The second line contains *n* integers $a_1,  a_2,  ...,  a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9)$.

**Output**

Print a single integer — the length of the maximum non-decreasing subsegment of sequence *a*.

Examples

Input

```
6
2 2 1 3 4 1
```

Output

```
3
```

Input

```
3
2 2 9
```

Output

```
3
```

Note

In the first test the maximum non-decreasing subsegment is the numbers from the third to the fifth one.

In the second test the maximum non-decreasing subsegment is the numbers from the first to the third one.



```python
n = int(input())
a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
 
f = [0]*n
f[0] = 1
max_value = 1
for i in range(1,len(a)):
        if a[i]>=a[i-1]:
               f[i] = f[i-1] + 1
               if f[i]>max_value:
                       max_value = f[i]
        else:
               f[i] = 1
 
print(max_value)
```
