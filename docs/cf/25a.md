# 25A. IQ test

brute force, 1300, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/25/A

Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to find out which one of the given *n* numbers differs from the others. Bob observed that one number usually differs from the others in evenness. Help Bob — to check his answers, he needs a program that among the given *n* numbers finds one that is different in evenness.

**Input**

The first line contains integer *n* (3 ≤ *n* ≤ 100) — amount of numbers in the task. The second line contains *n* space-separated natural numbers, not exceeding 100. It is guaranteed, that exactly one of these numbers differs from the others in evenness.

**Output**

Output index of number that differs from the others in evenness. Numbers are numbered from 1 in the input order.

Examples

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
a = [i % 2 for i in a]
sum_val = sum(a)
if sum_val == 1:
    print(a.index(1) + 1)
else:
    print(a.index(0) + 1)
```



```python
n = int(input())
l = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

cnt_even = 0

for i in range(n):
    if l[i]%2==0:
        cnt_even += 1

if cnt_even == 1:
    for i in range(n):
        if l[i]%2==0:
            print(i+1)
            break
else:
    for i in range(n):
        if l[i]%2 != 0:
            print(i+1)
            break
```



```python
n = int(input())
l = input().split()
m = ''
for i in range(n):
    m = m + str(int(l[i])%2)

if m.count('1')==1:
    print(int(m.index('1'))+1)
else:
    print(int(m.index('0'))+1)
```
