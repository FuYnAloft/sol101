# 1328A. Divisibility Problem

math, 800, https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1328/A

You are given two positive integers 𝑎 and 𝑏. In one move you can increase 𝑎 by 1 (replace 𝑎 with 𝑎+1). Your task is to find the minimum number of moves you need to do in order to make 𝑎 divisible by 𝑏. It is possible, that you have to make 0 moves, as 𝑎 is already divisible by 𝑏. You have to answer 𝑡 independent test cases.

**Input**

The first line of the input contains one integer $𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤10^4)$ — the number of test cases. Then 𝑡t test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains two integers 𝑎a and $𝑏 (1≤𝑎,𝑏≤10^9)$.

**Output**

For each test case print the answer — the minimum number of moves you need to do in order to make 𝑎a divisible by 𝑏b.

Example

Input

```
5
10 4
13 9
100 13
123 456
92 46
```

Output

```
2
5
4
333
0
```



逐步加1尝试，会超时。

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    res = a % b
    if res == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(b - res)
```
