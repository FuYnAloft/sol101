Little Dima misbehaved during a math lesson a lot and the nasty teacher Mr. Pickles gave him the following problem as a punishment. 

Find all integer solutions x ($0 < x < 10^9$) of the equation:

$x = b·s(x)^a + c$, 

where *a*, *b*, *c* are some predetermined constant values and function *s*(*x*) determines the sum of all digits in the decimal representation of number *x*.

The teacher gives this problem to Dima for each lesson. He changes only the parameters of the equation: *a*, *b*, *c*. Dima got sick of getting bad marks and he asks you to help him solve this challenging problem.

**Input**

The first line contains three space-separated integers: *a*, *b*, *c* (1 ≤ *a* ≤ 5; 1 ≤ *b* ≤ 10000; - 10000 ≤ *c* ≤ 10000).

**Output**

Print integer *n* — the number of the solutions that you've found. Next print *n* integers in the increasing order — the solutions of the given equation. Print only integer solutions that are larger than zero and strictly less than $10^9$.

def s(n):
    return sum([int(i) for i in str(n)])

a,b,c = map(int, input().split())
ans = []
for i in range(1,82):
    y = b * (i**a) + c
    if y <= 0 or y >= 10**9:
        continue
    if s(y) == i:
        ans.append(y)

print(len(ans))
if ans:
    print(*ans)
