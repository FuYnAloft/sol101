# 1833B. Restore the Weather

greedy, sortings, 900, https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1833/B

You are given an array $𝑎_i$ containing the weather forecast for Berlandia for the last 𝑛 days. That is, $𝑎_𝑖$ — is the estimated air temperature on day 𝑖 (1≤𝑖≤𝑛).

You are also given an array 𝑏 — the air temperature that was actually present on each of the days. However, all the values in array 𝑏 are mixed up.

Determine which day was which temperature, if you know that the weather never differs from the forecast by more than 𝑘 degrees. In other words, if on day 𝑖 the real air temperature was 𝑐, then the equality $|𝑎_𝑖−𝑐|≤𝑘$ is always true.

For example, let an array 𝑎 = [1,3,5,3,9] of length 𝑛=5 and 𝑘=2 be given and an array 𝑏 = [2,5,11,2,4]. Then, so that the value of $𝑏_𝑖$ corresponds to the air temperature on day 𝑖, we can rearrange the elements of the array 𝑏 so: [2,2,5,4,11]. Indeed:

- On the 11st day, |𝑎1−𝑏1|=|1−2|=1, 1≤2=𝑘 is satisfied;
- On the 22nd day |𝑎2−𝑏2|=|3−2|=1, 1≤2=𝑘 is satisfied;
- On the 33rd day, |𝑎3−𝑏3|=|5−5|=0, 0≤2=𝑘 is satisfied;
- On the 44th day, |𝑎4−𝑏4|=|3−4|=1, 1≤2=𝑘 is satisfied;
- On the 55th day, |𝑎5−𝑏5|=|9−11|=2, 2≤2=𝑘 is satisfied.

**Input**

The first line of input data contains a single integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤10^4^) — the number of test cases.

The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers 𝑛 (1≤𝑛≤10^5^) and 𝑘 (0≤𝑘≤10^9^) — the number of days and the maximum difference between the expected and actual air temperature on each day.

The second line of each test case contains exactly 𝑛 integers — elements of array 𝑎 ($−10^9≤𝑎_𝑖≤10^9$).

The third line of each test case contains exactly 𝑛 integers — elements of array 𝑏 ($−10^9≤𝑏_𝑖≤10^9$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛 over all test cases does not exceed 10^5^, and that the elements of array 𝑏 can always be rearranged so that the equality |𝑎𝑖−𝑏𝑖|≤𝑘 is true for all 𝑖.

**Output**

On a separate line for each test case, output exactly  numbers — the values of air temperature on each of the days in the correct order.

If there is more than one answer — output any of them.

Example

input

```

6 1
-1 3 -2 0 -5 -1
-4 0 -1 4 0 0
3 3
7 7 7
9 4 8
```

output

```
2 2 5 4 11
0 4 -1 0 -4 0
8 4 9
```



这题的k几乎是冗余条件

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    j, k = map(int, input().split())

    l1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v = [(l1[i], i) for i in range(j)]
    v.sort()

    l2 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l2.sort()

    z = [0] * j
    for i in range(j):
        z[v[i][1]] = l2[i]

    for data in z:
        print(data, end=" ")
    print()
```
