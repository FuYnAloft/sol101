# 1475A. Odd Divisor

math, number theory, 900, https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1475/A

You are given an integer 𝑛. Check if 𝑛 has an **odd** divisor, greater than one (does there exist such a number 𝑥 (𝑥>1) that 𝑛 is divisible by 𝑥 and 𝑥 is odd).

For example, if 𝑛=6, then there is 𝑥=3. If 𝑛=4, then such a number does not exist.

**Input**

The first line contains one integer $𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤10^4)$ — the number of test cases. Then 𝑡 test cases follow.

Each test case contains one integer $𝑛 (2≤𝑛≤10^{14})$.

Please note, that the input for some test cases won't fit into 32-bit integer type, so you should use at least 64-bit integer type in your programming language.

**Output**

For each test case, output on a separate line:

- "YES" if 𝑛n has an **odd** divisor, greater than one;
- "NO" otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as positive).

Example

Input

```
6
2
3
4
5
998244353
1099511627776
```

Output

```
NO
YES
NO
YES
YES
NO
```



```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    
    # 不断除以 2 直到 n 是奇数
    while n % 2 == 0:
        n //= 2
    
    # 检查 n 是否大于 1
    if n > 1:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
```
