# 158A. Next Round

*special problem/implementation, 800, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/158/A

"Contestant who earns a score equal to or greater than the *k*-th place finisher's score will advance to the next round, as long as the contestant earns a positive score..." — an excerpt from contest rules.

A total of *n* participants took part in the contest (*n* ≥ *k*), and you already know their scores. Calculate how many participants will advance to the next round.

**Input**

The first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *k* (1 ≤ *k* ≤ *n* ≤ 50) separated by a single space.

The second line contains *n* space-separated integers *a*~1~, *a*~2~, ..., a~n~ (0 ≤ a~i~ ≤ 100), where a~i~ is the score earned by the participant who got the *i*-th place. The given sequence is non-increasing (that is, for all *i* from 1 to *n* - 1 the following condition is fulfilled: a~i~ ≥ a~i~ + 1).

**Output**

Output the number of participants who advance to the next round.

Examples

input

```
8 5
10 9 8 7 7 7 5 5
```

output

```
6
```

input

```
4 2
0 0 0 0
```

output

```
0
```

Note

In the first example the participant on the 5th place earned 7 points. As the participant on the 6th place also earned 7 points, there are 6 advancers.

In the second example nobody got a positive score.



统计不小于第k位选手得分的人数

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
score = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
num = 0
k_score = score[k-1]
for i in range(n):
	s = score[i]
	if s >= k_score and s>0:
		num += 1
print(num)
```

short code

```python
i=lambda:map(int,input().split())
n,k=i()
a=list(i())
print(sum([x>=(a[k-1] or 1) for x in a]))
```
