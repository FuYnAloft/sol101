# 433B. Kuriyama Mirai's Stones

dp, implementation, sorting, 1200

https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/433/B

Kuriyama Mirai has killed many monsters and got many (namely *n*) stones. She numbers the stones from 1 to *n*. The cost of the *i*-th stone is $v_i$. Kuriyama Mirai wants to know something about these stones so she will ask you two kinds of questions:

1. She will tell you two numbers, *l* and *r* (1 ≤ *l* ≤ *r* ≤ *n*), and you should tell her $\sum\limits_{i=l}^rv_i$.  
2. Let $u_i$ be the cost of the *i*-th cheapest stone (the cost that will be on the *i*-th place if we arrange all the stone costs in non-decreasing order). This time she will tell you two numbers, *l* and *r* (1 ≤ *l* ≤ *r* ≤ *n*), and you should tell her $\sum\limits_{i=l}^ru_i$. 

For every question you should give the correct answer, or Kuriyama Mirai will say "fuyukai desu" and then become unhappy.

**Input**

The first line contains an integer *n* ($1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5$). The second line contains *n* integers: $v_1, v_2, ..., v_n (1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9)$ — costs of the stones. 

The third line contains an integer *m* ($1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5$) — the number of Kuriyama Mirai's questions. Then follow *m* lines, each line contains three integers *type*, *l* and *r* (1 ≤ *l* ≤ *r* ≤ *n*; 1 ≤ *type* ≤ 2), describing a question. If *type* equal to 1, then you should output the answer for the first question, else you should output the answer for the second one.

**Output**

Print *m* lines. Each line must contain an integer — the answer to Kuriyama Mirai's question. Print the answers to the questions in the order of input.
