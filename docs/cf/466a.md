# 466A. Cheap Travel

implementation, 1200, https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/466/A

Ann has recently started commuting by subway. We know that a one ride subway ticket costs *a* rubles. Besides, Ann found out that she can buy a special ticket for *m* rides (she can buy it several times). It costs *b* rubles. Ann did the math; she will need to use subway *n* times. Help Ann, tell her what is the minimum sum of money she will have to spend to make *n* rides?

**Input**

The single line contains four space-separated integers *n*, *m*, *a*, *b* (1 ≤ *n*, *m*, *a*, *b* ≤ 1000) — the number of rides Ann has planned, the number of rides covered by the *m* ride ticket, the price of a one ride ticket and the price of an *m* ride ticket. 

**Output**

Print a single integer — the minimum sum in rubles that Ann will need to spend.

Examples

input

```
6 2 1 2
```

output

```
6
```

input

```
5 2 2 3
```

output

```
8
```

Note

In the first sample one of the optimal solutions is: each time buy a one ride ticket. There are other optimal solutions. For example, buy three *m* ride tickets.



```python
n,m,a,b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
 
min_v = min(n*a, b*(n//m) + (n%m)*a, n*b, b*(n//m) + b )
if m >= n:
        print( min(b, min_v) )
else:
        print( min_v )
```
