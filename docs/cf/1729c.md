# 1729C. Jumping on Tiles

constructive algorithms/strings, 1100, https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1729/C

Polycarp was given a row of tiles. Each tile contains one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet. The entire sequence of tiles forms the string 𝑠.

In other words, you are given a string 𝑠 consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

Initially, Polycarp is on the **first** tile of the row and wants to get to the **last** tile by jumping on the tiles. Jumping from 𝑖-th tile to 𝑗-th tile has a cost equal to $|𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥(𝑠_𝑖)−𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥(𝑠_𝑗)|$, where 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥(𝑐) is the index of the letter 𝑐 in the alphabet (for example, 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥('a')=1, 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥('b')=2, ..., 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥('z')=26) .

Polycarp wants to get to the 𝑛-th tile for the minimum total cost, but at the same time make **maximum** number of jumps.

In other words, among all possible ways to get to the last tile for the **minimum** total cost, he will choose the one with the **maximum** number of jumps.

Polycarp can visit each tile **at most once**.

Polycarp asks you to help — print the sequence of indices of string 𝑠s on which he should jump.

**Input**

The first line of the input contains an integer $𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤10^4)$ — the number of test cases in the test.

Each test case is given by the string $𝑠 (2≤|𝑠|≤2⋅10^5)$, where |𝑠|— is the length of string 𝑠. The string 𝑠 consists of lowercase Latin letters.

It is guaranteed that the sum of string lengths 𝑠 over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5^.

**Output**

The answer to each test case consists of two lines.

In the first line print two integers 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡, 𝑚, where 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡 is the minimum total cost of the path, and 𝑚 is the maximum number of visited tiles Polycarp can make to get to 𝑛n-th tiles for the minimum total cost 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡 (i.e. the number of jumps is 𝑚−1).

In the next line print 𝑚 different numbers $𝑗_1,𝑗_2,…,𝑗_𝑚 (1≤𝑗_𝑖≤|𝑠|) $— the sequence of indices of the tiles Polycarp will jump on. The first number in the sequence must be 1 (that is, 𝑗~1~=1) and the last number must be the value of |𝑠| (that is, 𝑗~𝑚~=|𝑠|).

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Note

In the first test case, the required path corresponds to the picture:

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMyhf/img/main/img/202309052332422.png)

In this case, the minimum possible total cost of the path is achieved. Since 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥('l')=12, 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥('o')=15, 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥('g')=7, 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥('i')=9, 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥('c')=3, then the total cost of the path is |12−9|+|9−7|+|7−3|=3+2+4=9.



```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    s = input()
    n=len(s)
    a=[]
    l, h = ord(s[0])-96, ord(s[-1])-96
    for i in range(1, n-1):
        a.append([ord(s[i])-96, i+1])
    a.sort()
    if l>h:a.reverse()
    res=[1]
    low, high = min(l, h), max(l, h)
    for v in a:
        if low<=v[0]<=high:
            res.append(v[1])
    res.append(n)
    print(high-low, len(res))
    print(*res)
```
