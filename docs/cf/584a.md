# 584A. Olesya and Rodion

constructive algorithm, math, 1000, https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/584/A

Olesya loves numbers consisting of *n* digits, and Rodion only likes numbers that are divisible by *t*. Find some number that satisfies both of them.

Your task is: given the *n* and *t* print an integer strictly larger than zero consisting of *n* digits that is divisible by *t*. If such number doesn't exist, print - 1.

**Input**

The single line contains two numbers, *n* and *t* (1 ≤ *n* ≤ 100, 2 ≤ *t* ≤ 10) — the length of the number and the number it should be divisible by.

**Output**

Print one such positive number without leading zeroes, — the answer to the problem, or - 1, if such number doesn't exist. If there are multiple possible answers, you are allowed to print any of them.

Examples

input

```
3 2
```

output

```
712
```



```python
n,t = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

if t==10 and n==1:
        print(-1)
elif t==10 and n>1:
        for i in range(n-1):
                print(1, end='')

        print(0)

else:
        for i in range(n):
                print(t, end='')

        print()

```
