# 1195C. Basketball Exercise

dp, 1400, https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1195/C

Finally, a basketball court has been opened in SIS, so Demid has decided to hold a basketball exercise session. 2⋅𝑛 students have come to Demid's exercise session, and he lined up them into two rows of the same size (there are exactly 𝑛 people in each row). Students are numbered from 1 to 𝑛 in each row in order from left to right.

Now Demid wants to choose a team to play basketball. He will choose players from left to right, and the index of each chosen player (excluding the first one **taken**) will be strictly greater than the index of the previously chosen player. To avoid giving preference to one of the rows, Demid chooses students in such a way that no consecutive chosen students belong to the same row. The first student can be chosen among all 2𝑛 students (there are no additional constraints), and a team can consist of any number of students.

Demid thinks, that in order to compose a perfect team, he should choose students in such a way, that the total height of all chosen students is maximum possible. Help Demid to find the maximum possible total height of players in a team he can choose.

**Input**

The first line of the input contains a single integer 𝑛 (1≤𝑛≤10^5^) — the number of students in each row.

The second line of the input contains 𝑛 integers $ℎ_{1,1},ℎ_{1,2},…,ℎ_{1,𝑛} (1≤ℎ_{1,𝑖}≤10^9)$, where $ℎ_{1,𝑖}$is the height of the 𝑖-th student in the first row.

The third line of the input contains 𝑛 integers $ℎ_{2,1},ℎ_{2,2},…,ℎ_{2,𝑛} (1≤ℎ_{2,𝑖}≤10^9)$, where $ℎ_{2,𝑖}$ is the height of the 𝑖-th student in the second row.

**Output**

Print a single integer — the maximum possible total height of players in a team Demid can choose.

In the second example Demid can choose the following team as follows:

```python
n = int(input())
h1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
h2 = list(map(int, input().split()))

dp1 = [0] * n
dp2 = [0] * n

dp1[0] = h1[0]
dp2[0] = h2[0]

for i in range(1, n):
    dp1[i] = max(dp2[i - 1] + h1[i], dp1[i - 1])
    dp2[i] = max(dp1[i - 1] + h2[i], dp2[i - 1])

print(max(dp1[-1], dp2[-1]))
```
