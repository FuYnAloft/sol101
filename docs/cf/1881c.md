# 1881C. Perfect Square

Brute force, implementation, 1200, https://codeforces.com/contest/1881/problem/C

Kristina has a matrix of size 𝑛 by 𝑛, filled with lowercase Latin letters. The value of 𝑛 is **even**.

She wants to change some characters so that her matrix becomes a *perfect square*. A matrix is called a *perfect square* if it remains unchanged when rotated 90∘90∘ clockwise **once**.

Here is an example of rotating a matrix by 90^∘^:

In one operation, Kristina can choose any cell and replace its value with the next character in the alphabet. If the character is equal to "z", its value **does not change**.

Find the **minimum** number of operations required to make the matrix a *perfect square*.

For example, if the 4 by 4 matrix looks like this:



$\matrix{ a & b & b & a \cr b & c & \textbf{b} & b \cr b & c & c & b\cr a & b & b & a \cr }$



then it is enough to apply 11 operation to the letter **b**, highlighted in bold.

**Input**

The first line of the input contains a single integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤100) — the number of test cases.

Then follows the description of each test case.

The first line of each test case contains a single **even** integer 𝑛 (2≤𝑛≤1000) — the number of rows and columns in the matrix.

Then follows 𝑛 lines, each containing exactly 𝑛 lowercase Latin letters.

It is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛 over all test cases does not exceed 1000.

**Output**

For each test case, output a single number on a separate line: the **minimum** number of operations required for Kristina to obtain a *perfect square*.

```python
def solve():
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n//2):
        for j in range(n//2):
            M = [A[i][j], A[j][~i], A[~i][~j],A[~j][i]]
            c = max(M)
            for e in M:
                ans += ord(c) - ord(e)
    return ans
